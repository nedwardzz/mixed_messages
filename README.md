# CodeCademy Mixed Messages Project!

Hi there! My name is Nick Edwards, and I'm from Maine!
This is actually my first markdown doc!<br>
I have to say, I might only be 12% through the Full-Stack Course, 
but this has all been really cool to learn!

I'm looking forward to meeting fellow coders within this community!
Happy Coding!

## Project Summary

The purpose of this program is to generate random messages.
<br>When the user executes the program, 3 pieces of data will join to create a random message.

Even though this is a simple project to pros I'm sure, I intend to document my methods as I complete the project.
Capturing my methods will be a great reference to fall back on, build from, and hey, if it helps you too, that's great!
My goal is simply to learn, learn from, and support others along the coding journey.
<br>About a year ago, I knew hardly anything about coding. I still have so much to learn, but the fact that I'm writing this on my mac in VS Code, versioning with GitHub, and seeign the results on my README in the browser is really cool!
