# CodeCademy Mixed Messages Project!

Hi there! My name is Nick!
This is actually my first markdown doc!
I have to say, I might only be 12% through the Full-Stack Course, 
but this has all been really cool to learn!

I'm looking forward to meeting fellow coders within this community!
Happy Coding!

## Project Summary

The purpose of this program is to generate random messages.
When the user executes the program, 3 pieces of data will join to create a random message.

Even though this is a simple project to pros I'm sure, 
I intend to document my methods as I complete the project
Capturing my methods will be a great reference to fall back on, 
and hey, if it helps you too, that's great!
