# CodeCademy Mixed Messages Project!

Hi there! My name is Nick Edwards, and I'm from Maine!
This is actually my first markdown doc!<br>
I have to say, I might only be 12% through the Full-Stack Course, 
but this has all been really cool to learn!

I'm looking forward to meeting fellow coders within this community!
Happy Coding!

## Project Summary

The purpose of this program is to generate random messages.
<br>When the user executes the program, 3 pieces of data will join to create a random message.

Even though this is a simple project to pros I'm sure, I intend to document my methods as I complete the project.
Capturing my methods will be a great reference to fall back on, build from, and hey, if it helps you too, that's great!
My goal is simply to learn, learn from, and support others along the coding journey.
<br>About a year ago, I knew hardly anything about coding. I still have so much to learn, but the fact that I'm writing this on my mac in VS Code, versioning with GitHub, and seeign the results on my README in the browser is really cool!

## Methods

### 1. Plan Your Project
- The program is simple. We need to create a random message made up of 3 elements, and each can be whatever we want them to be!
- This is a great opportunitiy to be creative, and have some fun!
- For my approach, I'm going to create 4 arrays named:
    - *mixedMessages*:     An array to store all 3 types of elements
    - *reactions*:         The first element that stores types of reactions
    - *observations*:      The second element that stores types of _obviously humorously rude_ observations
    - *suggestions*:       The third element that stores again, _obviously humorously rude_ suggestions

- Understand that I in no way shape or form condone any messages that the generator may spit out.
- My goal is simply to create a humorous message generator that when read and applied to 0 context or persons, one might just laugh :joy_cat:
- Let's get started!


### 2. Come Up With a Topic
- As previously stated, my goal is to make a message generator that returns messages that are rude, but yet comical
- The messages will consist of 3 sections, a reaction, observation, and a suggestion
    - An example would be "Yikes! I think you need a shower! Do better!"



### 3. Create Script & Run Locally
